**Answer:**

Well, on *Kanban* you use a _Kanban Board_, this visualizes the entire work process and enables _transparency_.

On a well-structured Kanban board with a clear ticket design you can easily see:

* Which work is currently blocked.
* Who works on what.
* How much work is in which degree of completion.

If this information is permanently available to you, you will quickly develop a feeling for a healthy state of the system. You will see immediately when things deviate 
from the norm and when you need to find out how to correct them.

## Q2: What are _WIP limits_ and why are they so important on Kanban?

**Difficulty**: `Junior`

**Answer:**

_Work in progress_ (WIP) limits set the maximum amount of work that can exist in each status of a workflow. Limiting the amount of work in progress makes it easier to identify inefficiency in a team's workflow.

WIP limits improve throughput and reduce the amount of work _"nearly done"_, by forcing the team to focus on a smaller set of tasks. At a fundamental level, WIP limits encourage a culture of _"done"_. More important, WIP limits make blockers and bottlenecks visible. Teams can swarm around blocking issues to get them understood, implemented, and resolved when there is a clear indicator of what existing work is causing a bottleneck. Once blockages are removed, work across the team begins to flow again. These benefits guarantee that increments of value are delivered to customers sooner, making WIP limits a valuable tool in agile development.

## Q3: What type of *Kanban* strategy would you use on a team that is completely new to *Kanban* and why?

**Difficulty**: `Senior`

**Answer:**

I thing that I definitely would go with a _Individual WIP to Team Kanban Strategy_, but let me explain the reason.

In many situations, teams that are new to the Kanban method are either _reluctant_ to make major changes or _unsure_ of how to deploy the Kanban approach. Hence, implementing WIP limits at the individual team member level will likely be the least intrusive and easiest to apply without disrupting existing organizational processes.

However, I believe that is important to say that once the team gets comfortable with *Kanban*, a better approach like _Constant WIP to Team Kanban_ or _Aggregated Team Kanban to Team Kanban_ should be used as a next step.
